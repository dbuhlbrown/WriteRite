WriteRite

I had an idea to make a multi-platform script writing software in Electron. I ran into numerous issues, primarily, using the contenteditable attribute. I had read going in that this would have numerous problems, but I was hoping my use-case was narrow enough to avoid them.

One main thing I wanted was to make sure this software didn't require an internet connection. I have a few ideas for ways to solve some of the major problems with contenteditable, but I haven't had time to implement them all.
